claim-2209,Surface temperatures can show short-term cooling when heat is exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean which has a much greater heat capacity than the air,evidence-631206,Since the rising parcel of air is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere to make up for the loss the parcel of air is losing energy which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature of the air parcel,
claim-2209,Surface temperatures can show short-term cooling when heat is exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean which has a much greater heat capacity than the air,evidence-1144500,This is due to the larger heat capacity of oceans and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation,

claim-2209,Surface temperatures can show short-term cooling when heat is exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean which has a much greater heat capacity than the air,evidence-225191,As more ice melts there is less solar reflectivity and less heat is reflected away from the Earth causing more heat to be absorbed and retained in the atmosphere and soil In addition to the El events glacial melt is contributing to the rapid turnover of sea surface temperatures and ocean salt content by diluting the ocean water and slowing the Atlantic conveyor belt usually swift dive because of a top layer of buoyant cold fresh water that slows the flow of warm water to the north,
claim-2209,Surface temperatures can show short-term cooling when heat is exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean which has a much greater heat capacity than the air,evidence-990887,As the atmosphere is warmed nearest the equator the hot air at the surface of our planet is heated causing it to rise and draw in cooler air to take its place creating what is known as circulation cells,
